Health system leaders evaluating mobile market investments reasonably ask about return on investment. The question is legitimate. Resources are finite. Competing priorities abound.

But answering it requires honesty about what can and can't be measured.

## What ROI Means in This Context

Financial ROI in the strict sense asks: does the investment generate returns exceeding its cost? For a commercial investment, this means profits. For a healthcare investment in community health, the calculation is more complex.

Potential returns from a hospital mobile market include reduced healthcare utilization (fewer hospitalizations, ED visits, and complications from poorly managed chronic conditions), improved quality metrics (better diabetes control, lower blood pressure), increased patient engagement and satisfaction, and community benefit value (real benefits that also help meet regulatory requirements).

The challenge is measuring these returns directly and attributing them to the mobile market intervention specifically.

## What Can Be Measured

Several metrics are clearly measurable.

Program costs are straightforward: vehicle costs, staffing, operations, overhead. These can be tracked accurately.

Participation metrics are trackable: customers served, transactions completed, SNAP/EBT redemptions, produce prescription vouchers redeemed, repeat customer rates.

Customer demographics and health status can be captured, particularly when programs integrate with clinical systems. You can know whether participating patients have diabetes, hypertension, or other conditions of interest.

Health metrics for participating patients can be tracked for those with clinical relationships. If a patient shops at your mobile grocery market and also receives care at your system, you can monitor their HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, and other indicators over time.

## Where Measurement Gets Difficult

Attributing health improvements to the mobile market specifically is harder than measuring the improvements themselves.

Participating patients may have other interventions simultaneously. Medication changes. Lifestyle coaching. Disease management programs. Isolating the mobile market's contribution requires careful study design, often with control groups, which most operational programs can't implement.

Healthcare utilization changes (the most financially meaningful outcome) have many drivers. If a diabetes patient has fewer hospitalizations after starting to use the mobile market, is it because of the mobile market? Or medication adherence? Or disease progression? Or other factors? Correlation is observable. Causation is harder to establish.

Long-term outcomes take years to manifest. Preventing a cardiovascular event through improved diet might take a decade. Most programs can't wait that long for ROI demonstration.

## What the Evidence Suggests

Produce prescription programs, a close proxy for hospital mobile markets, have accumulating evidence. Studies show improved biomarkers for participants, with some evidence of reduced healthcare costs. Effect sizes vary. Not all studies are rigorous. But the direction is consistently positive.

One often-cited study found that a produce prescription program for food-insecure patients with diabetes showed improved HbA1c and reduced healthcare costs, with estimated savings exceeding program costs. This is promising. But it's one study. Generalization is uncertain.

The honest summary: there's reason to believe hospital mobile markets can improve health and potentially reduce costs, but we don't have definitive ROI calculations that would satisfy a skeptical CFO. The evidence is directionally positive, not conclusively proven.

## How to Think About Investment

Given measurement limitations, how should health systems evaluate mobile market investments?

Compare to alternatives, not to perfection. The question isn't whether mobile markets have proven ROI. It's whether they're a reasonable use of community health investment compared to other options. Many accepted interventions (community health education, screening programs, navigation services) lack definitive ROI evidence.

Consider strategic value beyond financials. Mobile markets demonstrate commitment to community health, support patient relationships, and address a problem (food insecurity) that's visible and meaningful to communities. This has value even if it's not captured in ROI calculations.

Use realistic evidence standards. Requiring peer-reviewed proof of cost savings before investment would preclude most innovation. Requiring a reasonable theory of impact and some supporting evidence is more practical.

Build in measurement from the start. Even without perfect attribution, programs that track participation and outcomes generate useful information. Over time, this data supports better understanding of impact.

## A Reasonable Framework

For health systems evaluating mobile market investment.

**Yes, pursue if**: food access is a documented need in your community, you can integrate with clinical programs, you can sustain funding beyond a pilot, and you're willing to invest in measurement.

**Maybe, investigate further if**: you're uncertain about community need or unclear on how to integrate with clinical care.

**Probably not, at least not yet, if**: you can't sustain funding beyond a year or two, you lack capacity for integration and measurement, or food access isn't a priority need in your service area.
