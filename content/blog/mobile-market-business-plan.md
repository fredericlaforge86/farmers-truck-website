A business plan for a mobile market serves multiple purposes. It
clarifies your own thinking. It communicates with potential funders. It
guides operational decisions. Whether you're a food bank launching a
new program or a nonprofit expanding into mobile food access, a
structured plan improves your chances of success.

Here's what a complete mobile market business plan should cover.

Executive Summary
-----------------

Start with a concise overview. One page maximum. Cover your
organization's mission and why a mobile grocery store fits. The
community need you're addressing. Your basic operating model.
Anticipated costs and funding strategy. Expected outcomes.

This section is often written last but read first. Make it clear and
compelling. A funder should understand your program from this page
alone.

Community Need Assessment
-------------------------

Document the problem you're solving with specificity.

Geographic analysis: Where are the food access gaps in your service
area? Use USDA food access research, local data, and your own community
knowledge. Map areas without nearby grocery stores. Identify
transportation deserts. Find concentrations of food-insecure
populations.

Population data: Who lives in these areas? Income levels, SNAP
participation rates, health indicators, demographic composition.
Quantify the number of households or individuals affected by limited
fresh food access.

Current resources: What food access options currently exist? Food
pantries, farmers markets, grocery stores within reach. Where are the
gaps that current resources don't fill?

Community input: Document conversations with community members,
organizations, and leaders. What do people say they need? How did you
involve the community in identifying the problem and shaping the
solution?

Program Design
--------------

Describe how your mobile market will operate.

Service model: Mobile market truck, trailer, or van? How many stops per
week? What schedule? How long at each stop?

Target customers: Who specifically are you trying to serve? Low-income
families? Seniors? Patients with chronic conditions? Be specific.

Product selection: What will you sell? Fresh produce only, or also
dairy, eggs, staples? How does product selection match customer needs?

Pricing strategy: At cost? Below cost with subsidy? Retail competitive?
What's your philosophy on pricing and how does it affect accessibility?

Stop locations: Where will you operate? List planned or prospective
locations. How did you select them? What community partnerships support
each location?

Operations Plan
---------------

Detail the logistics of running the program.

Staffing: How many people? Paid, volunteer, or hybrid? What roles and
responsibilities? Who manages the program day-to-day?

Sourcing and inventory: Where will products come from? Food bank
networks, distributors, local farms? How will you manage inventory,
storage, and spoilage?

Vehicle and equipment: What vehicle will you use? Owned or leased? What
equipment is needed? Refrigeration, POS systems, display fixtures?

Compliance: What permits, licenses, and insurance are required? How will
you handle food safety? SNAP/EBT authorization status?

Financial Plan
--------------

Lay out the economics clearly.

Startup costs: Vehicle acquisition, equipment, initial inventory, launch
marketing, permits, and initial operating capital. Total startup
investment needed.

Annual operating budget: Staffing, fuel, maintenance, inventory,
insurance, permits, administrative overhead. Break out by category.

Revenue projections: Expected sales revenue based on realistic stop
counts, customer projections, and transaction sizes. Be conservative.

Funding requirements: Gap between revenue and costs. How much external
funding do you need annually? For how many years?

Funding strategy: Where will funding come from? Grants, organizational
support, health system partnerships, sponsorships? Specific sources if
identified.

Outcomes and Evaluation
-----------------------

Define success and how you'll measure it.

Output metrics: Stops operated, customers served, pounds distributed,
SNAP transactions, repeat customer rates.

Outcome metrics: Customer food access changes, dietary improvements,
health indicators if partnered with healthcare.

Evaluation plan: How will you collect data? When will you assess
progress? How will results inform program adjustments?

Risk Assessment
---------------

Acknowledge what could go wrong and how you'll address it.

Common risks: Lower-than-expected customer turnout, funding gaps,
vehicle breakdowns, staffing turnover, community resistance.

Mitigation strategies: For each risk, what's your contingency plan? How
will you adapt if assumptions prove wrong?

Timeline
--------

Provide a realistic implementation schedule.

Pre-launch phase: Planning, partnerships, funding, procurement. How long
and what milestones?

Launch phase: Soft launch, initial operations, community building. When
do you go live?

Growth phase: Expansion, optimization, sustainability. What does year
two and three look like?

A well-prepared business plan demonstrates that you've thought through
the program seriously. It builds funder confidence and guides your own
decision-making. Invest the time to do it well.
