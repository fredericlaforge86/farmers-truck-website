Health systems have gotten better at identifying food insecurity. Standardized screening tools like the Hunger Vital Sign are now integrated into clinical workflows. Primary care. Chronic disease management. Maternal health settings. The screening works. It identifies patients who struggle to access adequate food.

But identification creates an obligation. When a patient discloses food insecurity, what happens next?

Too often, the answer is a referral to resources that are difficult to access. A pamphlet with food pantry addresses. Documentation in the chart with no concrete follow-up. Screening without intervention is incomplete.

## The Gap Between Screening and Action

The logic of food insecurity screening is sound. Food access affects health outcomes, particularly for diet-related chronic conditions that consume enormous healthcare resources. Identifying patients with food insecurity allows for targeted intervention.

The problem is the intervention side. Most health systems lack robust pathways from identification to resolution. A positive screen might trigger a social work referral, but social workers are often overloaded and food resources are fragmented. A patient might receive a list of food pantries, but pantries require transportation, operate limited hours, and may not offer the fresh produce that supports dietary management.

The result is a pattern we've seen repeatedly. Health systems screen at high rates. They document food insecurity accurately. But they don't meaningfully improve fresh food access for identified patients. The data accumulates. The problem persists.

## What Effective Intervention Looks Like

Effective post-screening intervention removes barriers rather than simply providing information.

Transportation is often the core barrier. Patients who screen positive for food insecurity frequently lack reliable transportation. Telling them where food is available doesn't help if they can't get there. Interventions that bring food to patients address this directly.

Timing and convenience matter. Food pantries with limited hours conflict with work schedules. Resources that require appointments add friction. Effective interventions meet patients where they are, on schedules that work for their lives.

Dignity affects participation. Some patients won't use traditional food assistance due to stigma, even when they qualify and need it. Interventions that feel like normal shopping rather than charity achieve higher participation rates.

A hospital mobile market addresses all three barriers. It brings food to locations patients already visit. Hospital campuses. Clinics. Community sites. It operates on accessible schedules. It provides a shopping experience rather than a handout.

## Integrating Mobile Markets with Clinical Workflows

The most effective hospital mobile market programs build explicit connections between screening and intervention.

Referral pathways from clinical encounters to mobile market information ensure patients who screen positive learn about the resource. This might be a warm handoff from a social worker, information provided by the screening clinician, or follow-up outreach from a care coordinator.

Schedule alignment places mobile market stops at times and locations that work for the patient population. A hospital campus stop during clinic hours allows patients to shop as part of an existing visit. Stops at community sites serve patients in their neighborhoods.

Produce prescription programs add another layer. Patients receive vouchers that subsidize or cover their purchases. This removes the cost barrier alongside the access barrier.

Tracking participation allows the health system to monitor whether identified patients actually use the resource. This data closes the loop, confirming that screening leads to action rather than just documentation.

## The Case for Investment

Health systems might reasonably ask: why invest in mobile grocery stores when food assistance programs already exist?

The answer is that existing programs aren't reaching the patients being identified. If patients who screen positive were successfully accessing food through existing resources, their food insecurity would resolve. Persistent positive screens indicate that current referral pathways aren't working.

A mobile market represents a more direct intervention. Rather than hoping patients navigate to fragmented external resources, the health system brings healthy food access into its own sphere of influence. The intervention becomes as concrete as a prescription.

The cost is real. Mobile market programs require ongoing investment. But so does the alternative: continued poor health outcomes, repeated hospitalizations, and chronic disease progression driven by inadequate nutrition. Mobile markets offer a way to actually do something about the food insecurity that screenings identify.

## From Screening to Outcomes

Screening is the easy part. The hard part is what comes after.

Health systems serious about addressing food insecurity need to evaluate their current post-screening pathways honestly. Are identified patients actually accessing food resources? If not, why not? What barriers prevent connection?

For many systems, mobile markets have become a key answer. Not the only intervention. But a practical one that removes the barriers making other resources inaccessible.
