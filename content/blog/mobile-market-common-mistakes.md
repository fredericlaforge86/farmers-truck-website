After seeing mobile markets launch, grow, struggle, and sometimes fail,
patterns emerge. The same mistakes appear repeatedly. Often made by
well-meaning operators who simply didn't know what they didn't know.

Learning from others' experiences beats learning from your own
failures.

Underestimating Operational Complexity
--------------------------------------

The most common mistake is treating a mobile market as a simple add-on
to existing programs. It's not.

Operating a mobile grocery store involves logistics, inventory
management, food safety, vehicle maintenance, scheduling, customer
service, and financial tracking. Each of these requires attention.

Organizations that assign mobile market management to someone who
already has a full-time job often struggle. The market becomes a
neglected afterthought. Quality suffers. Community trust erodes.

The fix: Dedicate sufficient staffing and management attention. If you
can't resource it properly, reconsider whether you should do it at all.

Launching Without Community Relationships
-----------------------------------------

Showing up in a neighborhood with no prior engagement almost guarantees
slow starts. Communities don't automatically embrace new programs,
especially from outside organizations. Without trusted advocates
promoting your market, customer acquisition is painfully slow.

The fix: Spend months building relationships before launching. Identify
community champions. Earn trust through presence and listening. Never
launch cold.

Choosing Locations for Convenience
----------------------------------

It's tempting to pick locations that are easy. Places you know. Short
driving distances. Partners who readily agree. But convenient locations
aren't necessarily high-need locations. You may end up serving
populations who have other options while missing those who don't.

The fix: Start with need mapping. Identify where food access gaps are
greatest. Then figure out logistics for serving those areas. Let need
drive location selection, not convenience.

Spreading Too Thin
------------------

Enthusiasm leads to adding stops. Another neighborhood. Another partner
request. Another opportunity. But each stop requires time, inventory,
and community relationship maintenance. Too many stops means inadequate
attention to each.

Customers notice when you seem rushed, when product quality varies, or
when community engagement is superficial. Better to be excellent at ten
stops than mediocre at twenty.

The fix: Start with a manageable number of stops. Build excellence and
consistency. Expand only when you've demonstrated success and have
resources to maintain quality at increased scale.

Depending on Single Funding Sources
-----------------------------------

A grant that covers your first two years feels like a win. Until year
three arrives with no replacement. Programs that depend on a single
funder are fragile. When that funding ends, the program ends.

The fix: Diversify funding from the start. Combine grants from multiple
sources, organizational support, health system partnerships, and earned
revenue. No single source should represent more than 40 to 50 percent of
your budget.

Unrealistic Self-Sufficiency Expectations
-----------------------------------------

Some programs launch expecting to become self-sustaining on sales
revenue within a few years. This rarely happens for mission-driven
mobile markets. Serving low-income populations with subsidized pricing
doesn't generate profits. Sales can contribute to costs but typically
won't cover them entirely.

The fix: Plan for ongoing funding needs from the start. Budget for what
operations actually cost, not what you hope they'll cost. Make the case
for sustained investment.

Ignoring What's Not Working
----------------------------

Loyalty to initial plans can blind operators to reality. A stop that
isn't performing after six months of consistent effort probably won't
magically improve at month twelve. Products customers don't buy aren't
going to start selling. Approaches that aren't working should be
changed.

The fix: Track data honestly. Review performance regularly. Be willing
to discontinue stops, change products, or modify approaches based on
what you learn. Adaptation is strength, not failure.

Neglecting Vehicle Maintenance
------------------------------

Vehicles require maintenance. Refrigeration systems need service.
Equipment wears out. Operators focused on daily operations sometimes
defer maintenance until breakdown. Which always happens at the worst
possible time.

A mobile market truck that can't operate because it's in the shop
damages customer relationships built over months. Consistency is your
product. Breakdowns undermine it.

The fix: Budget for maintenance. Schedule preventive service. Address
small problems before they become big ones. Have contingency plans for
vehicle downtime.

Weak Evaluation and Learning
----------------------------

Programs that don't track what's working can't improve
systematically. Without data on customer counts, sales by location,
product movement, and customer feedback, decisions become guesswork.

The fix: Build simple tracking from day one. Review data regularly. Use
evidence to guide adjustments. Evaluation isn't bureaucratic overhead.
It's how you get better.
