Mobile markets don't require sophisticated technology, but the right
tools make operations smoother and provide data for improvement. Here's
what to consider for point-of-sale systems, inventory management, and
scheduling.

Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems
---------------------------

Your POS system handles transactions and often much more. For mobile
grocery stores, key requirements include several things.

EBT/SNAP capability is non-negotiable for serving food-insecure
populations. Not all POS systems support EBT transactions. Verify before
purchasing. Some require separate EBT terminals. Others handle
everything in one system.

Wireless connectivity allows processing transactions anywhere your
market operates. Cellular data connections are standard. Having a backup
option (mobile hotspot on a different carrier) helps when signals are
weak.

Inventory tracking integration varies. Some systems track what's sold
automatically. Others require separate inventory management. Integrated
systems reduce manual work but may cost more.

Durability for mobile environments matters. Systems will be set up and
broken down daily, used outdoors in various weather, and handled by
multiple people. Consumer-grade tablets in flimsy cases don't last.

Popular options for mobile market POS include Square, Clover, and
specialized systems like MarketLink designed for farmers markets and
mobile vendors. Costs range from free (Square with percentage-based
transaction fees) to \$50 to \$150/month for more featured systems.

Inventory Management
--------------------

Tracking what you have, what sells, and what spoils matters for
financial sustainability and service quality.

At minimum, track what you buy (cost of goods), what you sell (by
product and location), and what you lose to spoilage or damage. This
data reveals which products are worth carrying and which stops are
financially productive.

Simple approaches work for smaller operations. A spreadsheet tracking
purchases, sales, and waste captures essential information. Manual
counts before and after markets verify accuracy.

Integrated POS-inventory systems automate much of this. Sales
automatically reduce inventory counts. Reorder alerts trigger when stock
is low. Reports show movement patterns over time. The time savings
matter as operations scale.

Temperature monitoring is critical for food safety. Refrigerated
vehicles need temperature logging to verify that cold chain is
maintained. Digital temperature monitors with logging capability provide
documentation if questions arise.

Scheduling and Route Management
-------------------------------

For operations with multiple stops, staff, and volunteers, scheduling
gets complex.

Route planning affects efficiency. Sequencing stops to minimize driving
time and maximize selling time requires thought. Mapping tools (Google
Maps, route planning apps) help optimize.

Staff scheduling needs to account for driver availability, market
staffing needs, and volunteer coordination. Calendar tools (Google
Calendar, scheduling apps like When I Work) help coordinate.

Communication with stops and customers benefits from simple systems.
Texting apps, email newsletters, or social media can notify customers of
schedule changes, special products, or cancellations.

Data Collection for Improvement
-------------------------------

Beyond operational needs, technology enables learning and improvement.

Customer counts by location help identify high and low performers. Some
POS systems track this. Simple clicker counters work too.

Transaction size and mix reveal customer behavior. Are people buying
more or less over time? Are certain products more popular at certain
locations?

Customer feedback collection, whether through simple surveys, comment
cards, or digital feedback tools, provides qualitative insight that
numbers miss.

For programs partnered with health systems, tracking which customers
have clinical connections and correlating participation with health
metrics requires more sophisticated data management and privacy
considerations.

What You Actually Need
----------------------

Many mobile markets overcomplicate technology decisions. Here's a
minimal viable setup.

A tablet-based POS with EBT capability and basic reporting. Square is
the common starting point. Free hardware. Transaction-based fees. EBT
support. Adequate reporting.

A spreadsheet for inventory tracking, reconciled weekly. Graduate to
integrated systems when the manual work becomes burdensome.

A shared calendar for scheduling and a group text thread for day-to-day
coordination.

Temperature loggers for refrigeration compliance.

This setup costs under \$500 plus transaction fees and covers essential
needs. Add complexity only when it solves real problems.

Common Technology Mistakes
--------------------------

Over-investing in systems before understanding needs leads to paying for
features you don't use.

Under-investing in EBT capability excludes your core customer base.

Failing to back up data means losing everything when devices fail.

Not training staff on systems creates inconsistent use and unreliable
data.

Ignoring data you collect defeats the purpose of collecting it. Simple
data, actually used, beats sophisticated data that sits in reports.
