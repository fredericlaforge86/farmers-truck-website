Funders reasonably want to understand what their investments achieve.
But impact measurement in mobile markets requires realistic expectations
about what can be measured, how confidently, and at what cost. This
framework helps funders and operators align on appropriate metrics.

Levels of Measurement
---------------------

Mobile market impact can be measured at several levels, each with
different confidence and cost implications.

Output metrics measure what the program does: stops operated, customers
served, transactions completed, pounds of produce distributed, SNAP/EBT
redemptions processed. These are highly measurable, relatively
inexpensive to track, and directly controllable by the program.

Outcome metrics measure changes for participants: increased produce
access, improved dietary intake, changes in food security status. These
require customer surveys or tracking, cost more to measure, and show
relationship between program and participant effects.

Impact metrics measure broader effects: health improvements, reduced
healthcare utilization, community-level fresh food access changes. These
require sophisticated evaluation design, significant cost, and often can
only suggest rather than prove causation.

Most mobile grocery stores should measure outputs thoroughly, measure
some outcomes where feasible, and be modest about claiming impact
without rigorous evidence.

Core Metrics for Every Program
------------------------------

Regardless of program size or sophistication, track these basics.

Operational metrics: Number of market days, stops per week, hours of
operation. Demonstrates program delivery.

Customer metrics: Total customers served (unique if possible), customers
per stop, repeat customer rate. Shows reach and engagement.

Transaction metrics: Total transactions, average transaction size,
SNAP/EBT transaction percentage. Reveals economic activity and
population served.

Product metrics: Pounds or dollars of produce distributed, product mix.
Quantifies food access provided.

These metrics require only basic tracking through POS systems and simple
record-keeping. Every program can capture them.

Outcome Metrics Worth Pursuing
------------------------------

For programs with capacity, additional outcome measurement adds value.

Customer food access surveys: Ask customers whether the mobile market
changed their food access, what they would do without it, and how it
affects their shopping. Simple surveys administered periodically capture
self-reported outcomes.

Dietary intake indicators: Brief surveys asking about fruit and
vegetable consumption frequency can track changes over time for repeat
customers. Validated instruments exist (dietary screeners, for example).

Food security status: Using standardized food security screening (like
the Hunger Vital Sign) periodically with regular customers can indicate
whether participation correlates with improved food security.

Customer demographics: Understanding who you serve. Income levels, age,
household composition. Demonstrates reach to target populations.

Health Outcome Measurement
--------------------------

For programs seeking health outcome evidence, the bar is higher.

Partner with health systems that can track patient participation and
correlate with clinical data (blood pressure, glucose, weight). This
requires data sharing agreements and research infrastructure.

Use comparison groups where possible. Outcomes for mobile market
participants compared to similar non-participants strengthen causal
claims.

Track over sufficient time. Health changes take months to years, not
weeks. Short-term measurement may miss real effects.

Accept limitations. Definitive proof that mobile markets cause specific
health outcomes is methodologically difficult. Promising evidence with
appropriate caveats is realistic. Iron-clad proof usually isn\'t.

What Funders Should Ask For
---------------------------

Reasonable funder expectations include several things.

Core output metrics from every funded program. This is baseline
accountability.

Customer reach data demonstrating the program serves intended
populations (low-income, food-insecure, specific geographic areas).

Some outcome data for larger investments. Customer surveys and food
access indicators are reasonable to expect for grants above \$50,000 to
\$100,000.

Realistic impact claims. Programs shouldn\'t overstate evidence. \'We
served 5,000 customers and survey data shows improved food access\' is
honest. \'We reduced diabetes by 20%\' without rigorous evidence is not.

The Cost of Measurement
-----------------------

Measurement isn\'t free. Funders should consider whether to fund
evaluation specifically.

Basic tracking requires POS systems and modest staff time. Perhaps 5 to
10 percent of program cost.

Customer surveys require design, administration, and analysis. A few
thousand to \$20,000+ depending on rigor.

Health outcomes research requires partnerships, data infrastructure, and
possibly research staff. \$50,000 to \$200,000+ for meaningful studies.

Funders seeking rigorous impact evidence should budget for it explicitly
rather than expecting it as program overhead.
