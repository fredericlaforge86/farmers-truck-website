Stop locations determine everything about a mobile grocery store\'s
effectiveness. The right locations put you in front of customers who
need you. The wrong locations leave you serving empty parking lots.

Selection deserves careful thought.

Start with Need, Not Convenience
--------------------------------

The temptation is to start with locations that are easy. Places you
already know. Partners who\'ve offered space. Convenient logistics.

Resist this temptation.

Start instead with where need is greatest. Map food access gaps in your
service area. Identify neighborhoods without nearby grocery stores. Find
concentrations of food-insecure populations. Areas with high SNAP
enrollment. Low-income housing. Senior communities.

Then ask: within those high-need areas, what locations could work
logistically? This ordering matters. Location decisions driven by
convenience often miss the populations that need you most.

Types of Locations That Work
----------------------------

Several location types have proven effective for mobile markets.

Public housing and affordable housing complexes concentrate the
population you\'re trying to serve. Residents typically have limited
transportation and fixed incomes. The built environment provides natural
gathering spaces. Property managers can help promote the market to
residents.

Senior housing, both subsidized and market-rate, works well for similar
reasons. Older adults face mobility and transportation barriers.
They\'re often home during market hours. Social connection makes the
market appealing beyond just groceries.

Schools and community centers draw families and children. After-school
hours or weekend times can work. School partnerships can include
nutrition education and reach parents through school communications.

Churches and faith communities provide trusted spaces, especially in
neighborhoods where residents may be wary of unfamiliar programs. Faith
partners can promote the market through their networks.

Healthcare facilities like clinics, hospitals, and community health
centers connect to patients who\'ve been identified as food-insecure
through screening. Patients can shop as part of an existing healthcare
visit.

Employer sites can work for programs serving working populations,
particularly at worksites in areas with limited food access where
employees lack lunch options or after-work grocery access.

What Makes a Location Viable
----------------------------

Beyond need, several practical factors affect whether a location works.

Physical space: Is there room for the vehicle to park, set up, and serve
customers safely? Can customers access the mobile market without traffic
hazards? Is there shade or shelter?

Population density: Are there enough potential customers within walking
distance? A location might be high-need but too isolated to generate
traffic.

Visibility: Can people see the market from their homes or regular paths?
Visibility drives awareness and impulse visits.

Permission and partnership: Can you secure permission to use the space
consistently? Is there a partner who will help promote and support the
market? Locations without engaged partners are harder to build.

Schedule compatibility: Can you serve at times when your target
population is available and able to shop? A senior housing stop during
morning hours works differently than an employer stop after work.

Building Community Relationships First
--------------------------------------

The single biggest predictor of stop success is the strength of
community relationships at that location.

Before adding a stop, spend time in the community. Meet with property
managers, community leaders, resident councils, church leaders, or
whoever influences the location. Explain your program. Ask about
community needs. Listen to concerns.

Strong partners promote the market, encourage residents to try it, and
troubleshoot problems. They give you credibility you can\'t build alone.
Locations without this relationship tend to struggle.

Don\'t launch at a location where you don\'t know anyone. The market
will feel like an outside intrusion rather than a community resource.

Testing and Iteration
---------------------

Accept that your initial location choices won\'t all work. Some stops
will thrive. Others won\'t, despite reasonable assumptions.

Start with enough stops to test patterns but not so many that you\'re
spread thin. Eight to twelve stops is a reasonable starting range for a
new program.

Track results at each location: customer counts, sales, repeat rates.
After three to six months of consistent operation, you\'ll have data to
inform decisions.

Be willing to discontinue stops that aren\'t working and shift resources
to higher-performing locations or new opportunities. Persistence
matters. So does adaptation.

Common Mistakes
---------------

Choosing locations for convenience rather than need leads to serving
populations that have other options while missing those who don\'t.

Launching without community partnerships means starting cold, without
promotion or trust. Customer acquisition is slow and uncertain.

Spreading too thin across too many stops dilutes your presence at each.
Better to be excellent at eight stops than mediocre at fifteen.

Giving up too soon on promising locations doesn\'t account for the
trust-building that takes months. But staying too long at failing
locations wastes resources.
