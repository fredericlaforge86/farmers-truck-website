Not every mobile market succeeds. Programs close. Vehicles sit idle.
Community expectations go unmet. Understanding common failure patterns,
and the funding mistakes that enable them, helps funders make better
investments.

Funding Vehicles Without Operations
-----------------------------------

The classic failure: a funder provides \$150,000 for a mobile market
truck. The recipient acquires the truck. Then they discover they can\'t
afford to operate it.

Vehicles require ongoing fuel, maintenance, insurance, and staffing. A
single-vehicle program might need \$80,000 to \$120,000 annually in
operating costs. Without this funding, the vehicle sits unused. A
monument to poor planning.

What funders should do instead: Fund vehicles only when operating
funding is identified. Ask applicants to document their operational
budget and funding sources. Consider providing vehicle and first-year
operations as a package.

Short Time Horizons
-------------------

Mobile markets take time to build. Customer trust develops over months.
Stop locations need adjustment. Operations require learning and
refinement. A program evaluated at month six looks very different from
the same program at month eighteen.

One-year grants set programs up to fail. Just as they\'re gaining
traction, they\'re writing grant reports and scrambling for renewal
rather than building the program.

What funders should do instead: Provide multi-year funding wherever
possible. Two to three-year grants allow programs to develop beyond
startup struggles. If multi-year isn\'t possible, be clear about renewal
likelihood so programs can plan.

Unrealistic Self-Sufficiency Expectations
-----------------------------------------

Some funders expect mobile markets to become self-sustaining within a
few years. \'We\'ll fund startup, then you\'ll cover costs through
sales.\'

This rarely works for mission-driven programs. Serving low-income
populations with subsidized pricing doesn\'t generate profits. Sales
revenue can contribute to costs but seldom covers them entirely.

Programs that promise self-sufficiency to secure funding often fail when
the promise proves impossible. Or they shift to serving higher-income
customers, abandoning the mission that justified funding.

What funders should do instead: Set realistic expectations about ongoing
funding needs. Mission-driven mobile grocery stores are more like
libraries than businesses. Ongoing community investments, not
self-sustaining enterprises.

Overlooking Organizational Capacity
-----------------------------------

A compelling proposal doesn\'t mean a capable organization. Mobile
markets require logistics management, food handling expertise, community
relationships, and operational consistency. Organizations without these
capabilities struggle regardless of funding.

Funders sometimes prioritize mission alignment or community
representation over operational capacity. These factors matter, but they
don\'t substitute for ability to execute.

What funders should do instead: Assess organizational capability
alongside mission and need. Ask about relevant experience, key staff
qualifications, and operational infrastructure. Consider
capacity-building support alongside program funding.

Single-Funder Dependence
------------------------

Programs funded entirely by one source are fragile. When that funder\'s
priorities shift or budgets tighten, the program ends. Regardless of
community impact.

Funders sometimes enjoy being the sole supporter of a program, but this
creates unhealthy dependence. The program optimizes for one funder\'s
preferences rather than building broad support.

What funders should do instead: Encourage and support funding
diversification. Ask what other sources programs are pursuing. Consider
requiring matching funds to ensure multiple stakeholders.

Failing to Require Sustainability Planning
------------------------------------------

Programs that launch without sustainability plans often fail when
initial funding ends. The excitement of launch obscures the reality that
year three and four need funding too.

Funders who don\'t require sustainability planning enable this failure.
They fund promising launches without asking what comes next.

What funders should do instead: Require sustainability plans in grant
applications. Ask: What funding will sustain this program after our
grant ends? What are you doing now to build toward sustainability?
Update sustainability requirements in progress reports.

Not Learning from Failure
-------------------------

When mobile markets fail, valuable lessons often go uncaptured. Programs
close quietly. Funders move on to new priorities. The same mistakes get
repeated elsewhere.

What funders should do instead: Require honest final reports from
unsuccessful programs. What went wrong? What would they do differently?
Share learnings (appropriately anonymized) to benefit the field. Failure
isn\'t shameful. Failing to learn from it is.
