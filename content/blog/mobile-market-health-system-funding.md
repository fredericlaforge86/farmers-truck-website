Health system funding has become a significant source of support for
mobile markets. As hospitals recognize fresh food access as a health
determinant, they're investing in programs that address it.
Understanding how these partnerships work helps both health systems
structuring programs and operators seeking partners.

Why Health Systems Fund Mobile Markets
--------------------------------------

Health systems have multiple motivations for mobile market investment.

Community benefit obligations require nonprofit hospitals to demonstrate
community investment. Mobile grocery stores qualify as community health
improvement activities that can be documented on IRS Schedule H.

Population health strategy increasingly recognizes food access as
essential. Value-based care models that reward keeping patients healthy
create incentives to address social determinants like food insecurity.

Food-as-medicine frameworks treat food access as a legitimate healthcare
intervention. Mobile markets become clinical tools, not just community
outreach.

Patient need is visible through screening. When food insecurity
screening identifies thousands of food-insecure patients, health systems
face pressure to respond.

Partnership Models
------------------

Health system mobile market involvement takes several forms.

Direct operation: The health system owns and operates the mobile market
as part of its operations. The mobile market is staffed by health system
employees or contractors, appears on the hospital's budget, and
operates according to health system policies.

Advantages: Maximum control, direct integration with clinical care,
clear accountability. Challenges: Requires operational capability
hospitals may lack, higher direct costs.

Contracted partnership: The health system contracts with an external
mobile market operator. The health system provides funding. The operator
handles logistics and execution. Contract terms specify performance
expectations, reporting requirements, and integration points.

Advantages: Leverages specialized operational expertise, clearer cost
structure, less organizational complexity. Challenges: Less direct
control, requires effective contract management, partner selection
matters greatly.

Grant funding to community operators: The health system provides grants
to existing mobile market programs serving its community. This is
lighter-touch involvement. Financial support without operational
responsibility.

Advantages: Lowest administrative burden, supports existing community
infrastructure. Challenges: Limited influence over operations, harder to
integrate with clinical care, outcomes harder to attribute to health
system investment.

Funding Structures
------------------

How health systems financially support mobile markets varies.

Operating budget allocation treats mobile market expenses as hospital
operating costs, similar to other community health programs. Ongoing
funding is built into annual budgets.

Community benefit funds earmark resources specifically for community
benefit activities, including mobile markets. These funds may have
separate governance and reporting.

Grant awards (internal foundation): Hospital-affiliated foundations may
provide grants to mobile market programs, including the hospital's own
program or external operators.

Pass-through funding: Health systems may channel external grant funding
(from USDA, state programs, or private foundations) to mobile market
operations, serving as fiscal agent or administrative lead.

Integration Points
------------------

The most effective health system mobile market partnerships create
explicit connections to clinical care.

Referral pathways direct patients identified through food insecurity
screening to mobile market resources. This might be a warm referral from
social work, printed materials from clinical staff, or follow-up
outreach.

Produce prescription programs provide patients with vouchers redeemable
at the mobile market. The health system funds the vouchers. The mobile
market provides the redemption point.

Data sharing allows the health system to track which patients use the
mobile market and correlate participation with health outcomes. This
requires appropriate agreements and privacy protections.

Location placement puts mobile market stops at healthcare facilities:
hospital campuses, clinics, community health centers. Places patients
already go.

What Health Systems Should Expect
---------------------------------

Realistic expectations for health system mobile market investments.

Costs will be ongoing. Mobile markets require sustained funding, not
one-time grants. Budget for year-over-year support.

Utilization takes time to build. Patient participation grows as
awareness spreads. Don't expect immediate high volumes.

Attribution is imperfect. Connecting mobile market participation to
health outcomes definitively is methodologically difficult. Accept
reasonable evidence standards.

Operational learning is required. Even contracted partnerships require
health system attention to integration, promotion, and relationship
management.
