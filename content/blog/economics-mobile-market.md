Commercial mobile market viability depends on economics, not just
mission. Understanding revenue potential, cost structure, and break-even
requirements helps operators make realistic plans.

Revenue Drivers
---------------

Mobile grocery store revenue is a function of three factors: number of
stops, customers per stop, and average transaction size.

Stops per week varies by vehicle capacity and operator ambition. A
single-vehicle operation typically runs 12 to 20 stops weekly. More
stops means more potential revenue but also more operational demand.

Customers per stop varies enormously. From 10 to 15 at a struggling stop
to 80+ at a thriving one. New stops start slow. Established stops with
good community relationships perform better. Average across a mature
program might be 25 to 40 customers per stop.

Average transaction size depends on product selection, pricing, and
customer base. Grocery transactions tend to be smaller than supermarket
trips. Mobile market customers often buy for a few days rather than
stocking up. Typical averages range from \$12 to \$25 per transaction.

Example calculation: 15 stops x 30 customers x \$18 average = \$8,100
per week, or roughly \$420,000 annually in gross sales.

Cost Structure
--------------

Costs divide into startup and ongoing operations.

Startup costs include vehicle acquisition (\$80,000 to \$180,000),
equipment and POS systems (\$5,000 to \$15,000), initial inventory
(\$3,000 to \$8,000), permits and licensing (\$1,000 to \$3,000), and
marketing/launch costs (\$2,000 to \$5,000). Total startup: \$90,000 to
\$210,000.

Ongoing costs include cost of goods sold (typically 50 to 60% of revenue
for grocery operations), staffing (\$40,000 to \$80,000 annually for
paid staff), fuel and vehicle operation (\$10,000 to \$20,000),
maintenance (\$5,000 to \$12,000), insurance (\$8,000 to \$15,000), and
overhead (\$5,000 to \$15,000). Total ongoing: \$170,000 to \$280,000
annually, plus COGS.

Margin Analysis
---------------

Gross margins on grocery products typically run 35 to 50 percent. Fresh
produce might be 40 to 50 percent. Packaged goods might be 30 to 40
percent. Product mix determines overall margin.

Using the example above: \$420,000 revenue x 40% gross margin =
\$168,000 gross profit available to cover operating costs.

If operating costs (excluding COGS) are \$150,000 annually, that leaves
\$18,000 for vehicle depreciation, reinvestment, and profit. Workable,
but not lucrative.

If operating costs are \$200,000 annually, the operation loses \$32,000
before vehicle costs. Not viable without additional revenue or cost
reduction.

Break-Even Calculation
----------------------

To find break-even, determine what revenue level covers all costs.

If gross margin is 40% and operating costs (excluding COGS) are
\$150,000 annually, break-even revenue is \$150,000 divided by 0.40 =
\$375,000.

Divide by weeks (say, 50 operating weeks): \$375,000 divided by 50 =
\$7,500 per week needed to break even.

If average transaction is \$18, that's 417 transactions per week, or
about 28 per stop across 15 stops.

This calculation helps test assumptions. If you don't think you can
achieve 28 customers per stop on average, the model doesn't work
without changes to costs, prices, or scale.

Scale Effects
-------------

Single-vehicle operations are hard to make profitable. Fixed costs like
overhead, management, and insurance don't decrease proportionally when
volume is small.

Multiple-vehicle operations achieve better economics. A second truck
adds revenue capacity without doubling overhead. Management time spreads
across more sales. Purchasing power increases.

Operators who achieve profitability typically run two or more vehicles.
This isn't universal, but it's common enough to suggest that scale
matters.

Realistic Expectations
----------------------

For mission-driven organizations serving low-income populations, full
commercial viability may not be the right goal. Subsidized pricing and
serving areas with limited purchasing power don't maximize revenue.
These programs operate with grant support and accept operating losses as
the cost of achieving mission.

For commercial operators seeking viable businesses, the bar is higher.
Realistic targets might include year one operating at a loss while
building routes and customers. Year two approaching break-even on direct
operating costs. Year three achieving modest profitability, potentially
with expansion.

Few mobile markets become highly profitable. Most that sustain
themselves do so at modest margins after significant investment in
building customer bases.
